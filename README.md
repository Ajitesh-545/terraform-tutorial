# Terraform Tutorial

## 1. Basic

This section covers the fundamental concepts of Terraform, including installation, basic commands, and the structure of a Terraform configuration.

## 2. Boolean

Learn how to use Boolean values in Terraform configurations to control the flow of resources and modules.

## 3. Count

Understand how to use the `count` parameter to create multiple instances of a resource dynamically.

## 4. List

Explore the usage of lists in Terraform to manage collections of values, including creation, manipulation, and iteration.

## 5. Locals

Discover how to define and use local values within your Terraform configurations for improved readability and reusability.

## 6. Dynamic Block

Learn how to use dynamic blocks to generate repeated nested configuration blocks.

## 7. Maps

Get to know maps in Terraform for handling key-value pairs and their applications in configurations.

## 8. For Loop

Understand how to use for loops in Terraform to iterate over lists and maps to generate complex configurations.

## 9. For Each Loop

Explore the `for_each` meta-argument to create resources from a map or set of strings.

## 10. Modules Tutorial

Dive into Terraform modules to understand how to create, use, and manage reusable configurations.

## 11. Provisioner

Learn about provisioners in Terraform, which allow you to execute scripts or commands on your resources.

## 12. Terraform Workspace

Understand the concept of workspaces in Terraform to manage different states and environments in a single configuration.

## 13. State Locking

Understand the concept of state locking in Terraform to prevent concurrent operations that can lead to state corruption.

## 14. Remote State Locking

Explore remote state locking to manage Terraform state files in a shared environment and ensure safe and consistent operations.
